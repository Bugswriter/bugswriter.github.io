        As most people live in cities these days, many of us aren't exposed to
        nature — green, dense forests, mountains, starry nights, and beautiful
        landscapes. Rivers, waterfalls... it’s all becoming a distant dream. As
        people lose touch with it, they start craving it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Businesses are capitalizing on this craving. Nature, which should be our
        right as humans, is now a product. Just look at Instagram — going into
        nature, seeing mountains and the earth in its pure form, has become a
        trend, a glamorous show-off spectacle. Young people see these nature
        reels and feel a sudden urge to go on a trip... and that’s it.

        Tourism companies are making a business out of it. Was it always like
        this? I don't think so. Before we started destroying nature, people
        lived in it. It wasn’t sexy. It was harsh. It was normal. An ancient man
        wasn’t excited to see mountains — it was just there, part of life. They
        lived surrounded by nature and appreciated it constantly.
      </p>
      <p>
        But not anymore. Today, you have to pay to see what we've been
        destroying for centuries. Think of any place with even a hint of beauty
        — you can’t just walk there. It’ll cost you. Locals have turned homes
        into homestays, and they monetize what they already have. And why
        wouldn’t they?

        Some places get more tourists just due to geography. For example, in
        India, Manali is easily accessible and is flooded with visitors. Now, if
        you have even basic data analysis skills, you can see it clearly — more
        visitors means more content about it, more talk, and that creates a
        false perception that Manali is somehow more beautiful than other
        places. But beauty is highly subjective. You can’t rank nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        People might like a place for a hundred different reasons — local
        experiences, culture, weather, personal mood. The whole marketing
        machine behind tourist destinations is one of the most degenerate things
        in society today. I've been to parts of Northeast India that are far
        more beautiful than Manali — but no one talks about them because they’re
        hard to reach, and the package-tour crowd avoids them.

        We don’t even explore what the land we’re born in has to offer. Even on
        our so-called trips, we just waste time taking photos and creating video
        content. After building city lives and chasing economic dreams at the
        cost of nature, now we claim to care. Suddenly, we love nature...
        because we lack it. Yes, we are nature-deficit.
      </p>
      <p>
        We don’t know how to live in nature, how to weave a basket from tree
        bark, how to survive in the wild. It’s not our lifestyle anymore. We
        don't even teach it in formal education. Of course not — formal
        education exists to train us to produce wealth for a few, essentially
        turning us into economic slaves.

        So, we end up scrolling Instagram at midnight, staring at flashy videos
        of nature. That’s our relationship with the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was sick of these nature-obsessed people. So, I went to the mountains.
        I lived in Arunachal Pradesh — Tuting. I spent a long time there.
        Eventually, it started to feel normal, and I loved that feeling.
        Recently, while traveling to Tawang, I realized something — I had spent
        so much time surrounded by trees, rivers, and mountains that none of it
        caught my eye anymore. It never did. Even earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
        I cringe when I see tourists in Arunachal losing their minds at
        something we are all part of — nature. What felt refreshing was seeing
        kids and locals in Tuting, who are surrounded by mountains daily. To
        them, it's just life. And they know how to live it.
