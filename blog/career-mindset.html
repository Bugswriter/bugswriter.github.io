    <h1>Career : A Mindset of Slaves</h1>

    <h2>Where Did the Idea of a "Career" Come From?</h2>
    <p>
      Many students today live under pressure, worrying constantly about their
      "career." But rarely do we stop to ask:
      <em>Where did this concept originate?</em> Why do teachers and schools
      keep asking kids, <q>What do you want to become when you grow up?</q> And
      why does this idea not work for so many people?
    </p>

    <p>
      The idea of a "career" gained popularity largely due to the work of
      economist <strong>Adam Smith</strong> and his concept of the
      <strong>division of labor</strong>. <em>Division of labor</em> means
      breaking down work into smaller, specialized tasks so that each person
      performs one specific function, thereby increasing overall efficiency and
      output.
    </p>

    <p>
      This model became central after the industrial revolution. As corporations
      rose, people's needs evolved, living standards shifted—and so did
      expectations. Jobs became the new currency of stability. Education turned
      into a filter for employment, and expertise became the system’s favorite
      metric. Companies started seeking individuals willing to dedicate their
      entire lives to just one narrow field.
    </p>

    <h2>Alienation in the Age of Specialization</h2>
    <p>
      As Karl Marx pointed out, this system produces <em>alienation</em>. Yes,
      people are "free" to choose their path, but that freedom is often
      illusionary. With rising expenses, societal norms, and an economy built on
      consumption, most people don’t feel free—they feel trapped.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over time, the idea of a "career" restricts our thinking. We start
      believing we can only do one thing. We internalize competition. We silence
      our curiosity. And all of this pressure starts early—in school or
      college—when we’re still figuring out who we are.
    </p>

    <h2>Humans Are Not Machines</h2>
    <p>
      In ancient times, people weren’t bound to a single job for life. They
      explored multiple skills, sometimes out of necessity, sometimes out of
      passion. If someone stuck to one craft, it was never because a company
      demanded it—it was because they chose to.
    </p>

    <p>
      Contrast that with the modern structure. Take <strong>YouTube</strong> as
      an example. If a channel posts consistently on one topic, it grows. But if
      that same creator experiments across different topics, the algorithm
      punishes them.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m an engineer who uses Linux. The entire Unix philosophy, which inspired
      Linux, is built on the idea that each program should
      <em>do one thing and do it well</em>. It’s a brilliant design
      principle—for software. But humans aren’t software.
    </p>

    <p>
      Forcing people to specialize—to become a cog in one department—destroys
      their sense of novelty and joy. It may boost productivity, but it doesn’t
      nourish the soul. Doing many things imperfectly is far more human than
      doing one thing flawlessly under pressure.
    </p>

    <h2>The Invisible Hand of Platforms</h2>
    <p>
      YouTube’s algorithm isn’t designed for human freedom. It’s built for
      predictable growth. Channels with diverse content confuse the system, so
      they’re hidden. But what if a person has different interests? What if they
      treat their channel like a digital diary, not a business?
    </p>

    <p>
      The platform doesn’t care. Diversity in content is punished, even if it's
      a reflection of human creativity. The same principle applies across modern
      life—uniformity is rewarded, diversity is sidelined.
    </p>

    <h2>Specialization as Survival</h2>
    <p>
      In the past, people grew their own food and had multiple domestic skills.
      Now, most of us outsource everything. But to outsource, we need money. And
      to earn money, we specialize.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over time, we’re taught to believe that other areas of life are
      distractions. That a real "professional" gives 100% to their career. But
      this belief is not just toxic—it’s extreme.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yes, productivity rises. The economy grows. But ask yourself:
      <em>Is your life worth less than your country’s GDP?</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      This system creates intense competition, fuels mental illness, and removes
      freedom. Kids are brainwashed early into thinking their worth depends on
      specialization. That their identity must come from their job.
    </p>

    <h2>Career as Identity: A Modern Prison</h2>
    <p>
      Many people today can’t imagine a life outside their career. Their
      profession becomes their identity. It’s a subtle form of programming—where
      people, unknowingly, accept slavery-like ideas for the sake of structure,
      security, or approval.
    </p>

    <p>
      The only escape is to
      <strong>mentally break free from the idea of a “career.”</strong>
      Do what you enjoy. Do what matters personally or culturally. You don’t
      need to dedicate your entire life to a single field. That’s not
      nobility—it’s extremism.
    </p>

    <p>
      It’s okay to fail in the rat race. In fact, stepping away from it might be
      the only way to stay human.
