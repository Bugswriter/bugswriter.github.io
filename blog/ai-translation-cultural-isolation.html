  <h1>AI Translations and Cultural Isolation</h1>

  <p>Recently, I noticed the rise of LLM-based translations. YouTube now offers an AI dubbing feature, making videos available in multiple languages with surprisingly natural-sounding AI-generated audio. There's even a "Translate to &lt;language&gt;" button below the comments section now.</p>

  <p>Many see this development as progress—greater inclusion through language accessibility. But I don't see it that way. I see it as a threat. And there are serious downsides people ignore.</p>

  <p>I used to live in an off-grid region near the China border in India—Tuting, Arunachal Pradesh. Living there changed my perspective. I’ve never liked social media because of algorithmic bubbles, and how it floods people with foreign ideas—often destructive ones. But while living in that region, I noticed something interesting.</p>

  <p>People in that area mostly belong to tribal communities like the Adi or Tibetans. Tibetan, for instance, has dialect differences depending on the region. Most people are comfortable only with their local tone. Because of this, and the general lack of English or other major language skills, their social media usage was restricted to their own cultural circles. The algorithm recognized that and kept their feeds local—people from their own town, tribe, and language. They commented in Tibetan, posted in Tibetan, and were served content that reflected their own community. It created a natural cultural bubble.</p>

  <p>That changed my view of social media. I actually enjoyed watching their feeds. Most of it was people from the same town doing funny or mundane things—nothing overly dramatic or global. In this case, language acted as a protective wall for their cultural identity. The algorithm, ironically, helped them stay isolated in a good way.</p>

  <p>I firmly believe overexposure to foreign cultures is usually harmful. It creates identity conflict, cultural doubt, and unnecessary comparison. Western culture propagated globally because of one dangerous idea: individualistic freedom. Many fall for it, unaware of the mental and societal consequences.</p>

  <p>When I learned English as a kid, I drifted away from my local culture. I started watching Hollywood, English TV shows, and adopting foreign perspectives. That wasn't the case for many of my friends who didn’t speak English. They were protected in a sense. And now, with advanced translations, that cultural barrier is dissolving for everyone. These communities will inevitably be exposed to foreign ideas. Another wave of globalization disguised as accessibility.</p>

  <p>This AI translation tech is no different from other side-effects of globalization. It promises connection, but delivers confusion and mental noise. People get drawn into global events, far removed from their reality, and lose inner peace.</p>

  <p>We saw how globalization introduced digital connectivity, faster travel, and broader reach. But it didn’t improve society in any meaningful way. It promised efficiency. It delivered disorientation. This translation boom is just the next chapter in that same book.</p>

  <p>Some cultures are better off in isolation. There's no universal "right" way to live. What matters is what works for a community. If a certain way of life sustains them, let them have it. Forcing them to engage in unnecessary cultural comparisons and ideological wars is a disaster for humanity.</p>
