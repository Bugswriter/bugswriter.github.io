      <h3>
        On this page, you will find the cinema of my choice. my cherry-picked
        films collection
      </h3>
      <p>
        I find beauty in cinematographic shots and evocative scores. At just two
        hours, I believe films are too brief for complex storylines or deep
        character development. Therefore, I seek aesthetic visuals and immersive
        atmospheres over intricate plots.
      </p>
      <p>
        I typically avoid mainstream action, thrillers, or comedies. My
        preference leans towards thoughtful <i>dramas</i>. Many find my favored
        films slow, even "boring." When recommending from my list, I usually
        start with accessible stories, then gradually introduce others to the
        more meditative, melodic tones I enjoy. For me, it's a peaceful, almost
        meditative experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        I dislike violence or anything unnatural in films. I'm drawn to settings
        rich in <i>nature, village life, or ancient vibes</i>, though urban
        backdrops can sometimes appeal.
      </p>
      <p>
        My viewing habits lean heavily into <i>Asian cinema</i>â€”Japanese,
        Chinese, and Korean films are my staple. Indian films, despite my
        location, rarely offer the novelty I seek.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've sometimes considered filmmaking, having studied camera work and
        related elements. The rise of AI could potentially simplify this
        process, making it a future possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        While I check Rotten Tomatoes for credibility, I generally avoid deep
        dives into directorial specifics or technical analyses. Such discussions
        often diminish my personal viewing experience; I prefer to simply watch,
        appreciate, and move on without excessive attachment.
      </p>
      <p>
        All my films are downloaded and organized within my Jellyfin library. My
        entry into Korean cinema, and indeed my passion for it, began with my
        favorite actress: <i>Jun Ji-hyun</i>.
